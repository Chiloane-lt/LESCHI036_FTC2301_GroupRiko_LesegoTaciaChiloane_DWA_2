Scrimba Project to create a meme generator web app using React and the [Imgflip API](https://imgflip.com/api "Imgflip API Homepage").  

The aim of the project was to implement the following:

- Adding event listeners and handling events in React.
- Storing state and changing state natively in React.
- Using forms. Specifically getting and storing form data, as well as, processing data for different types of inputs.
- Rendering JSX elements based on conditions. Focus was on using the ternary operator or the && operator.
- Using APIs. Fetching and using data from APIs and also exploring how this relates with other types of side effects in React.
